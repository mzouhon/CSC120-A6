- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

It's really interesting how you can write methods that are univerasal to all the child classes of a parent class through the parent class but also have specific methods for the different child classes. It really simplifies writing classes that are similar to eachother. I was easily able to extend the classes and fix their constructors. However, it was difficult to work with the hashtable for the Library class at first. I kept getting the key and value fields mixed up but once I figured out, I was easily able to modify different parts of the hashtable. I would advise anyone taking the course in the future to thoroughly read the methods that can be used with the hashtable as it can make it easier to implement certain functionalities.
